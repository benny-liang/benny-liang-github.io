    <h1>How Key Club Opened My Eyes:</h1>
    <p>It was the beginning of my freshman year at WHS, and club rush week was in full swing. All of my friends were gravitating toward a booth with a bright yellow sign that read "Key Club" in bold letters. My first thought was, “What kind of club is this? Do they make keychains or something?” I was convinced it wasn’t for me, and I dismissed it as a trivial club. But then my friends explained that Key Club was all about giving students opportunities to serve their community, build character, and develop leadership skills. Honestly, I didn’t think much about self-improvement or my future at that point, so I wasn’t particularly interested. Over the course of the year, my friends convinced me to join a few events here and there. It wasn’t much, especially since I was still adjusting to my first year of high school. But then something changed during the summer of 2024. I started reflecting on myself and realized I wasn’t happy with where I was. I felt this overwhelming need to do something meaningful with my life. For as long as I could remember, I’ve always enjoyed helping people—whether it was giving a dog some food or helping an elderly person cross the street. That summer, when I received an email from the Key Club Director of Activities with a list of new volunteering opportunities, something clicked. I signed up for every event I could find. I was eager to make the most of my time, and I had nothing holding me back. Throughout June, July, and August, I dove headfirst into volunteering. I racked up over 200 volunteer hours, attending nearly every event that was available. I even went to my first Division Council Meeting (DCM) and got more involved with the larger Key Club community. Those months were transformative for me. I discovered how much I truly loved helping others. Looking back, I realize how much Key Club has shaped me. The friendships I’ve made and the memories I’ve created are ones I’ll carry with me for a lifetime. More than anything, I’ve found a purpose and passion for service that I never knew I had. And now, I want to open your eyes.</p>

    <p>Key Club is an international, student-led service organization for high school students. It is part of the Kiwanis International family, which aims to develop leadership skills through community service. Members participate in various volunteer activities like organizing fundraisers, hosting events, and supporting local causes. Key Club’s mission is to teach students the value of giving back to their communities while building character and leadership abilities. By being a part of Key Club, students often gain opportunities for networking, leadership roles, and personal growth while making a positive impact in their communities.</p>
    <h3>Now, how can you get involved?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Findout if your School offers a Key Club: Check if your high school has a Key Club. Many schools have a club that's open to all students.</li>
      <li>Attend General Meetings: Join general meetings to learn more about the club, its activities, and how you can get involved. General meetings are often held regularly(usually every month), and attending helps you stay updated on upcoming events and opportunities.</li>
      <li>Register as a Member: If you're interested, you'll need to pay your dues. This usually covers club expenses and allows your Divison to pay for certain events.</li>
      <li>Volunteer at Events: Starting to participate in the club’s volunteer opportunities is one of the most important parts of Key Club. This can range from helping at local events to organizing fundraisers. This is a great way to meet new people and contribute to your community.</li>
      <li>Take on Leadership Roles: Over time, you can apply for leadership positions within the club, such as officer roles (e.g., president, secretary, treasurer). These roles allow you to take a more active role in planning and decision-making </li>
      <li>Attend Division and District Events: Key Club has divisions and districts that organize events like Division Council Meetings (DCMs) and larger district conventions (DCONs). These provide networking opportunities and broader service projects.</li>
      <li>Stay Active: AND the most important part of being a Key Club member is staying <strong>ACTIVE</strong>. The more active you are, the more you'll get out of the experience. Attending events, participating in service projects, and bonding with other members will enhance your involvement.</li>
