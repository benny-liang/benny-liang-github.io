    <h1>How Key Club Opened My Eyes</h1>
    </font color>
    <p>It was the beginning of my freshman year at WHS, and club rush week was in full swing. All of my friends were gravitating toward a booth with a bright yellow sign that read "Key Club" in bold letters. My first thought was, “What kind of club is this? Do they make keychains or something?” I was convinced it wasn’t for me, and I dismissed it as a trivial club. But then my friends explained that Key Club was all about giving students opportunities to serve their community, build character, and develop leadership skills. Honestly, I didn’t think much about self-improvement or my future at that point, so I wasn’t particularly interested. Over the course of the year, my friends convinced me to join a few events here and there. It wasn’t much, especially since I was still adjusting to my first year of high school. But then something changed during the summer of 2024. I started reflecting on myself and realized I wasn’t happy with where I was. I felt this overwhelming need to do something meaningful with my life. For as long as I could remember, I’ve always enjoyed helping people—whether it was giving a dog some food or helping an elderly person cross the street. That summer, when I received an email from the Key Club Director of Activities with a list of new volunteering opportunities, something clicked. I signed up for every event I could find. I was eager to make the most of my time, and I had nothing holding me back. Throughout June, July, and August, I dove headfirst into volunteering. I racked up over 200 volunteer hours, attending nearly every event that was available. I even went to my first Division Council Meeting (DCM) and got more involved with the larger Key Club community. Those months were transformative for me. I discovered how much I truly loved helping others. Looking back, I realize how much Key Club has shaped me. The friendships I’ve made and the memories I’ve created are ones I’ll carry with me for a lifetime. More than anything, I’ve found a purpose and passion for service that I never knew I had. And now, I want to open your eyes.</p>
